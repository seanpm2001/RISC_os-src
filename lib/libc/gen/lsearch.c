/*
 * Linear search algorithm, generalized from Knuth (6.1) Algorithm Q.
 *
 * This version no longer has anything to do with Knuth's Algorithm Q,
 * which first copies the new element into the table, then looks for it.
 * The assumption there was that the cost of checking for the end of the
 * table before each comparison outweighed the cost of the comparison, which
 * isn't true when an arbitrary comparison function must be called and when the
 * copy itself takes a significant number of cycles.
 * Actually, it has now reverted to Algorithm S, which is "simpler."
